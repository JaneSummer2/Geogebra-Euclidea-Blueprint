# Geogebra-Euclidea-Blueprint
A Euclidea level developer similar to Geogebra.
It is a web application.
The names 'Geogebra' and 'Euclidea' are just references to their functions. Euclidea levels are designed using Geogebra's approach, and these levels are played in the end.

# purpose & motivation
In the GitHub repository [Euclidea-R-vival](https://github.com/MT9799/Euclidea-Re-vival) We are troubled by the level code in .gmt format: although these codes can design levels, they lack tools that can parse this code format.
So I have a dream: if there was a software like Geogebra that could quickly design levels and read .gmt files for gameplay, how great it would be!
But there aren't so many good things in the world, so I can only rely on myself to learn HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. The reason why it is made into a web application is simply because it is a GUI suitable for beginners to get started with.(laughs)

在github仓库 [Euclidea-Re-vival](https://github.com/MT9799/Euclidea-Re-vival)，我们因为.gmt格式的关卡代码头疼：这些代码虽然可以设计出关卡，但是缺少能解析这种代码格式的工具。
所以我有一个梦想：要是有一个软件能像Geogebra那样能快速设计关卡，又能读取.gmt文件进行游玩，那该多好啊！
但是天下没有这么多的好事，所以我只能靠自己，去学习HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT。之所以做成Web应用，只因这是适合初学者入门的GUI了吧（笑
